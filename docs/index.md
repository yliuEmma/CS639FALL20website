## Motivation

Visual content creation has become wildly applied in many industries. 
However, Manual image processing of recurring objects of choice from a massive amount of digital media
can be very tedious for the visual content creation process. Automated object detection and image
processing can free visual content creators from doing repetitive tasks, such as blurring out the same
object that occurs in a video, and allow them to focus more on the creative process.

Instead of manually adjusting each object in the image, I would like to automate this process and allow content creators to focus more on the creative process through object detection and image processing.

I want to make it simple, fast, and more accessible for beginners in visual content creation or for those who do not have enough budget.

## Current State-of-Art and My Approach

### Youtube Studio Face blur and Custom Blur:

will automatically blur the object as it moves.

select the faces that you'd like to blur, then click Apply.

### Photoshop object selection tool:

draw a rectangular region or a lasso around the object.

Object Selection tool automatically selects the object inside the defined region. 

### Smartphone's portrait mode:

### My Approach -- YOLO(You Only Look Once) with OpenCV libraries:
